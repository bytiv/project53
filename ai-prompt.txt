okay look we are gonna be making a website thats one page and we will need to make it to add on it a content-locker from OGAds, the idea of the website will be one page and it will for example be about making money and the users will want to download a book from our site but before getting there they will have to go through our content locker and complete one of the adds, now as for how the content locker will be, that will be on OGAds like specifying the amount of offers the user has to complete and so on, that's not your responsibility, your responsibility is to create the template and everything else just to inject that, use a simple index.html and css to create the whole thing and javascript too, and tell me if that will be enough for the whole thing to work. the design should be attractive and targeting young audience, now as for the traffic just to give you a general info it will be through ads we will run on facebook and tiktok. 

The website will claim that you can gain 29$ per day as the book has such proven methods and even more if you work harder!!  you get my idea. also use colors that will attract people of that gategory
